#  Simple File System (SFS)

A lightweight, educational implementation of a **simple file system** written in **C++**, operating on a **virtual disk** stored as a regular file.  
This project demonstrates how a file system works internally — including **superblocks, inodes, block management, mounting, and data read/write operations** — all simulated at the user level.

##  Overview

The **Simple File System (SFS)** simulates a real file system inside a **virtual disk image** (`disk0.img`) divided into fixed-size 4KB blocks.  
It provides a complete environment to **format**, **mount**, **create**, **read**, **write**, and **remove** files — just like a real operating system.

This project was built to help understand how data is organized and managed at the file system level.

##  Architecture

User Commands (Shell)
↓
File System Layer (fs.cpp)
↓
Disk Interface Layer (disk.cpp)
↓
Virtual Disk File (disk0.img)

| Layer | Description | Files |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Disk Layer** | Simulates physical disk operations (block read/write) | `include/sfs/disk.h`, `src/library/disk.cpp` |
| **File System Layer** | Implements file management, metadata, and allocation logic | `include/sfs/fs.h`, `src/library/fs.cpp` |
| **Shell Interface** | Command-line interface for interaction | `src/shell/sfssh.cpp` |
| **Visualization** | Flask + D3.js web UI for visualizing disk layout | `visualize_web.py`, `templates/index.html` |

---

##  Disk Layout

Each disk image is divided into 4KB blocks.  
The layout of blocks inside the virtual disk is as follows:

+-----------+-------------------+------------------+
| Block 0 | Blocks 1..N | Remaining Blocks |
| Superblock| Inode Blocks | Data Blocks |
+-----------+-------------------+------------------+

| Section | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Superblock (Block 0)** | Stores overall file system metadata |
| **Inode Blocks** | Contain file metadata structures (10% of total blocks) |
| **Data Blocks** | Store actual file content |

---

## Core Structures

### SuperBlock
'''cpp
struct SuperBlock {
  uint32_t MagicNumber;  // Unique FS identifier
  uint32_t Blocks;       // Total number of blocks
  uint32_t InodeBlocks;  // Number of blocks reserved for inodes
  uint32_t Inodes;       // Total number of inodes
};

Inode
struct Inode {
  uint32_t Valid;           // 1 if the inode is in use
  uint32_t Size;            // File size in bytes
  uint32_t Direct[5];       // Direct data block pointers
  uint32_t Indirect;        // Pointer to indirect block
};

IndirectBlock
struct IndirectBlock {
  uint32_t Pointers[1024];  // 1024 * 4B = 4KB block of pointers
};

Each file = one inode.
Supports 5 direct + 1 indirect block pointers (→ up to ~4 MB per file).'''

🏁 Summary

This project demonstrates the fundamental workings of a file system, including block-level storage, metadata management, and file I/O operations.
It provides a practical foundation for understanding how real operating systems manage persistent storage.

"From raw bytes to structured files — building a file system from scratch reveals the hidden world inside every hard drive."
